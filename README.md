# Gaming_Project
Create a program that uses OpenCV and tensorflow to learn how to play a video game on Steam

The controller contains the files needed to control the current game played on steam. This is done using python code which passes on keyboard presses and mouse coordinates to a bash scripts which then passes them onto the steam window playing the game.

The “game_vision” folder contains the code nededded to analyse the game currently being played frame by frame using OpenCV c++.
